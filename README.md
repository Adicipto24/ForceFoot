## Repository contents

This repository contains:

* A mechanical design suitable for Rhoban robots, that can be a good base
  to be adapted to fit your needs;
* Schematics for an electronics board containing all the components to get
  the values from the sensors and communicate them through dynamixel;
* A firmware compliant with the electronics;
* Documentation and examples.
