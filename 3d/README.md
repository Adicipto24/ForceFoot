## Gauges

The gauges here are 5KG nominal, with M4 on one side and M5 on the other. The
cleats are fixed on the M4 side, and the M5 is used to fix the gauges to the foot
part.

## Foot part

The `foot.ipt` represents the 3D-printed part for the foot, we recommend adjusting
the holes to fix it to the rest of your robot.

When printing it, you may fill this part with a reasonable amount of material.
